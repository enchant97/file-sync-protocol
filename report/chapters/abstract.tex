This report investigates into the domain of file synchronisation at the network level. Exploring whether a modern solution can be built to utilise modern technologies and out perform existing solutions. Prototypes are built and compared against the existing solutions (FTP, SMB and rsync) to achieve this, measuring total network overhead and performance via maximum transfer speed. The findings shown from testing shows that a newer solution could improve in the future by using methodologies such as building on top of UDP and implementing dynamic error correction. Although testing showed that more overhead was sent, transfer speed was dramatically increased compared to the existing solutions proving that networks can be better utilised using modern tooling.
