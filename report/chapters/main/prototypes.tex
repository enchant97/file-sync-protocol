As this project is purely an investigation into whether a more modern solution for transferring files can be produced, these prototypes will only focus on the minimum possible required to have functionality. This allows for each prototype to improve on the most important features. These are listed below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Error correction
	\item Sending files from client to server
	\item Adjustable settings, for testing
	\item Only support a single client connection
\end{itemize}

To test the prototypes, the previous methodology of testing will be used. This is documented in Appendix~\ref{sec:testing-environment}. On the virtualised network, these prototypes will use the maximum available MTU size which is 65,000 bytes which matches the previous tests.
