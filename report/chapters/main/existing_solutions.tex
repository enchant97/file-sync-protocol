\section{Solutions To Investigate}
To compare the prototypes against, a range of existing solutions need to be first investigated and tested to allow a more accurate comparison.

There are many solutions that have been created to transfer files. Listed below are the solutions that will be compared:

\begin{itemize}
	\item SMB2
    \item FTP
	\item rsync
	\item SyncThing
\end{itemize}


\section{How They Work}
\subsection*{FTP}
FTP is the oldest protocol (introduced in 1971) out of the ones that will be investigated. It allows for transferring files to and from a client and server. Since it was originally created to use NCP it uses two TCP sockets for each client to provide full-duplex communication, although TCP/IP is used which allows for full-duplex communication over one socket although the FTP protocol has never altered to provide compatibility. Having two sockets makes it harder for FTP to work over firewalls, and can even cause connection drops if no command packets are sent while a large data transfer is happening.
