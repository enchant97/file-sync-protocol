A lot as changed since the TCP/IP stack was put into use. We now rely heavily on computers to aid us in everyday life. An extreme amount of data is transferred across large networks powering the "cloud" that allows people to use powerful software on their many devices.

However with the greater demand and improvements to technologies there has been little improvement to existing lower level technologies such as protocols. As the world creates more data, most people do not want to lose it, so it is backed up using well established (and old) protocols such as the FTP family, SMB and rsync that are all based on the TCP protocol.

A modern solution could be very beneficial to be more efficient and fully utilise modern technologies that are available, while removing compatibility for archaic devices which could potently hinder any improvement.
